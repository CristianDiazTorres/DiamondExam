# DiamondExam
This project demonstrates an advanced Hardhat use case, integrating other tools commonly used alongside Hardhat in the ecosystem. The project comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
